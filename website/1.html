Venusaur, Charizard, Blastoise, Pikachu, and many other Pokemon have been discovered on planet Earth! 
Now's your chance to discover and capture the Pokemon all around you-so get your shoes on, step outside, and explore the world. You'll join one of three teams and battle for the prestige and ownership of Gyms with your Pokemon at your side.
Pokemon are out there, and you need to find them. As you walk around a neighborhood, your smartphone will vibrate when there's a Pokemon nearby. Take aim and throw a Poke Ball... You'll have to stay alert, or it might get away!</p>
<p>
Search far and wide for Pokemon and items
Certain Pokemon appear near their native environment-look for Water-type Pokemon by lakes and oceans. Visit PokeStops, found at interesting places like museums, art installations, historical markers, and monuments, to stock up on Poke Balls and helpful items.</p>
<p>
Catching, hatching, evolving, and more
As you level up, you'll be able to catch more-powerful Pokemon to complete your Pokedex. You can add to your collection by hatching Pokemon Eggs based on the distances you walk. Help your Pokemon evolve by catching many of the same kind.</p>
<p>
Take on Gym battles and defend your Gym
As your Charmander evolves to Charmeleon and then Charizard, you can battle together to defeat a Gym and assign your Pokemon to defend it against all comers.</p>
<p>
It's time to get moving-your real-life adventures await!</p>
